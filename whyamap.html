<body>

why are we working with a map?<br>
draft answer, August 14, 2022<br><br><br>


<blockquote>
a map shows where you live or maybe where you would like to live.<br><br>

a map is a representation of how a politico-socio-economic system interacts with the physical environment, but
for our demographic, for which there is little politico-socio-economic space and less and less physical space, a map is a destabilizing
reminder of erasure. maybe this is why we are working with a map. <br><br>

when i open a map of Toronto, i see a story but there is no "home".<br><br>

there must be a way to change the existing story so that there is "home".<br><br>

how?<br><br>

we have chosen to use this map for a very specific goal and to work with adding words to it, written (letters) and/or said out loud (sound).
we trust that there is power in our verbalizations, voices and ideas.<br><br>

can we work with a map however without participating in the colonization that they have traditionally enabled?
this question simply highlights our responsibility to participate in de-colonization.<br><br>
