    acknowledgment of our privilege<br><br>
    draft by claude wittmann,on July 8, 2021<br><br><br><br><br>

    <blockquote>


    <a>as artists, we acknowledge the privilege to be seen as white and/or educated and/or cismale
        and thus to be treated with a certain level of priority to the basic right to housing.</a><br><br>

    <a>we acknowledge that we are currently housed while still some of us and a lot of others in Toronto are going through grueling
        housing insecurity.</a><br><br>

    <a>we acknowledge that most if not all of us have not been a resident of an encampment and thus not experienced the City of
        Toronto's violent evictions.</a>
