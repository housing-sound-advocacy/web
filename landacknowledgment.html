          We acknowledge our privilege to live on traditional territory shared with us by many nations who
          have lived here and cared for it before and since settlers came. We live in Tkaronto/Toronto.<br><br>
        
          We acknowledge our discomfort with the 1787 Toronto Purchase, the 1805 Indenture, the 1923 Williams
          Treaties and possibly also with the 2010 $145 million settlement between Canada and the Mississaugas
          of New Credit First Nation and Treaty No. 13, because they imposed settlers' concept of land ownership
          and extinguished rights. In that sense, we consider the possibility that we are on a territory that was
          never considered through an equal nation-to-nation relationship and never ceded.<br><br>
        
          We acknowledge that our work on finding our home in Tkaronto/Toronto closely touches on land ownership. We largely
          favour public land ownership, but we acknowledge also that be it private or public, especially in Tkaronto/Toronto 
          where the City hasn't started a decolonizing process, land ownership does not recognize the spirit
          and concepts with which the land is considered and cared for by Indigenous communities, Indigenous 
          philosophy and knowledge.<br><br>
        
          We acknowledge to have knowledge that Tkaronto/Toronto is in the "Dish With One Spoon Territory". <br><br>
          
          The Dish With One Spoon is a treaty between the Anishinaabe, Mississaugas and Haudenosaunee that bound
          them to share the territory and protect the land. Subsequent Indigenous Nations and peoples, Europeans and
          all newcomers have been invited into this treaty in the spirit of peace, friendship and respect.<br><br>
        
          The "Dish", or sometimes it is called the "Bowl", represents what is now southern Ontario, from the
          Great Lakes to Quebec and from Lake Simcoe into the United States. *We all eat out of the Dish, all
          of us that share this territory, with only one spoon. That means we have to share the responsibility
          of ensuring the dish is never empty, which includes taking care of the land and the creatures we share it
          with. Importantly, there are no knives at the table, representing that we must keep the peace.<br><br>
          
          This was a treaty made between the Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee after the French and Indian War.
          Newcomers were then incorporated into it over the years, notably in 1764 with The Royal Proclamation/
          The Treaty of Niagara.<br><br>
        
          We acknowledge our inability at the moment to fully understand how to performatively and respecttully
          enact this treaty, but still hope that our work will give more to decolonization than to furthering colonization.<br><br>
